# TinkoffConcurrency

## TL;DR

```swift
// Make URLSessionDataTask conform to TCCancellable
extension URLSessionDataTask: TCCancellable {}

func download(from url: URL) async throws -> Data {
    await withCheckedThrowingCancellableContinuation{ completion in
        let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: URLRequest(url: url)) { data, _, error in
            if let data = data {
                completion(.success(data))
            } else if let error = error {
                completion(.failure(error))
            } else {
                completion(.failure(Errors.unknownError))
            }
        }

        task.resume()

        return task
    }
}
```

```swift
let channel = TCAsyncChannel<Int, Never>()
let filtered = channel
    .filter { $0 % 2 == 0 }

Task {
    // Available from iOS 13
    for await number in filtered.asyncValues {
        print("\(number)", terminator: " ")
    }
}

try await channel.send(1)
try await channel.send(2)
try await channel.send(3)

try channel.send(completion: .finished)
```

## Requirements

TinkoffConcurrency requires Swift 5.5 and higher, with support of Swift Concurrency. This way, all Xcode versions starting from 13.0 would work.
It's advisable to use Xcode at least 13.2.1 or higher, as it provides backward compatibility with iOS 13.0 and higher.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

TinkoffConcurrency is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'TinkoffConcurrency'
```

### Swift Package Manager

1. From _File_ menu, select _Add Packages..._

2. Enter `https://github.com/tinkoff-mobile-tech/TinkoffConcurrency` into repository URL

3. Select _Up to Next Major Version_, and use `1.1.0` as a minimum version

4. Select your project in _Add to Project_ and click _Add Package_

5. In opened dialog, choose target to add library to

## Documentation

The documentation is available here:

* [`main`](https://tinkoff-mobile-tech.github.io/TinkoffConcurrency/main/documentation/tinkoffconcurrency/)
* [`1.2.0`](https://tinkoff-mobile-tech.github.io/TinkoffConcurrency/1.2.0/documentation/tinkoffconcurrency/)

<details>
  <summary>

* [`1.1.0`](https://tinkoff-mobile-tech.github.io/TinkoffConcurrency/1.1.0/documentation/tinkoffconcurrency/)
</details>

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first. Example app is a small demo that
illustrates behavior of `withCheckedThrowingCancellableContinuation` for both cancellable and non-cancellable tasks, and compares that
to vanilla `withCheckedThrowingContinuation` behavior.

Example application needs iOS 15.0 to run, as it uses new SwiftUI features. It does NOT imply any restrictions of using TinkoffConcurrency
library on older iOS versions.
